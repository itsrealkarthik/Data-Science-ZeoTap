# Introduction
This project is a data science assignment for a Zeotap internship. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, and lookalike modeling using customer, product, and transaction data. The goal is to derive insights and build predictive models to understand customer behavior and identify potential lookalike customers.

The project structure includes:

`Data Files :` CSV files containing customer, product, and transaction data. <br>
`Jupyter Notebooks :` Notebooks for EDA, clustering, and lookalike modeling. <br>
`Excel Files :` An Excel file for lookalike modeling results. <br>
`Documentation :` A README file and a LICENSE file. <br> <br>
The project leverages popular data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. <br>
